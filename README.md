## Installation and Usage
Node.js and MySQL is required for the application to function.


## General Info
This application allows the user to go through a command line interface, to view their departments, roles, and employees, as well as add departments, roles and employees. They are also able to update an employee's role if they so desire. This project was fairly frustrating to get working correctly, and I faced quite a few hurdles that I eventually overcame.
